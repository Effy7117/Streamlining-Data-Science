### Automating End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline with Airflow and MLflow

A workflow was developed to forecast the number of deaths and respective causes, contributing to proactive public health planning and resource allocation. Using the Government of Canada's open-source dataset on causes of death in Alberta, a pipeline was built using Airflow to automate data extraction, transformation, loading, and model training tasks. 

Linux and bash scripting were employed to handle the data operations from the open-source dataset. 

MLflow was used to track model performance and system metrics, which helps with model monitoring, retraining, and deployment, significantly aiding strategy development. 

With Airflow, parallel processing has made task management seamless, speeding up data transformations and model training. 

MLflow's comprehensive tracking has simplified model comparison and optimization, making iterative improvements straightforward and efficient. It also facilitates easy sharing of experiment results and model artifacts, ensuring the code can be easily reproduced and built upon.
